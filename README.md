My intro to Git and all the marvels of code. 

I am Christian, 20 years of age, inspired by Mr. Friedman, and want to Make America Care Again. 
My hobbies include: golf, coffee, investing, and reading of course.  
My name is Dean Philip Young-Min Paulson and I am an adopted South Korean living in Boston, MA.  
I hope we can accomplish great things.
